Location based Activity Reminder App 

In everyday lives we have introduced some special ways of remembering tasks that needs to be executed in future. Such unique ways could be using post-it notes, sticky notes on the refrigerator, emailing oneself and reminding other people like family and friends to remind you back. For example, a person may send WhatsApp message which contains the list of groceries they have to purchase one they visit the supermarket.
Reminders play a vital role in cases where the details and the context must be attached with it like the location. In the example discussed above, the grocery list reminder should pop up if the user is crossing a supermarket. In this case the location where the task is being executed is very essential. Comparing it with the time when the user is sleeping or may be working in office, if this notification pops up, the probability of them remembering the task to be executed i.e., buying groceries would be significantly low. So here, location plays a significant role. Such a task can be classified as location-based task. Sometimes we resist the execution of some tasks due to social or technical limitations. These tasks include time-based tasks, for example tasking medicine at 5 pm is a task which can fall under this category.
Here, we would be focusing on location-based tasks and how can they be remembered and reminded at a perfect time in return of some pre-registered information from the user.
